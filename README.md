# SwiftyScience
 *Exploring the phone as a scientific tool*

SwiftyScience is meant to be a one part tool and one part exploration. It will expedite future projects where I want to incorporate some of the features I've built in here, and will also feature tools for general work in science (leaning towards my own work), such as various calculators.
